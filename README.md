## Objetive of the competition

The objetive of this competition was to predict the demand for rental electric bikes in Madrid between October and December 2022 
using data from January to September of the same year.


## Contents

In this repository you will find various .csv and .pyinb. 
The .ipynb files are the jupyter notebooks used to clean, transform, model and predict, and the .csv files are the predictions.
Because the initial dataset is too large, I will not inlcude it in this repository. If you wish to download it you can find it 
in the following kaggle page (competition link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/maas-demand-in-madrid/)

Despite the .ipynb files being long, the models end up being quite simple and using few features. The objective of these files is to show
the feature engineering behind the tests performed before the final version of these models in addition to the final result.
